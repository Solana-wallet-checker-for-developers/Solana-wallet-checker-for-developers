## Setting up Telegram Notifications (Optional)

Integrate Telegram notifications for instant alerts. Configure your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) in the 'telegram-settings.txt' file.

## Getting Started: Developer Guide

Download the pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself.

## Building the Project: Development Setup

Build the project and include all necessary dependencies. Use **vcpkg** for straightforward dependency management.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  If you havenâ€™t installed **vcpkg**, follow the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system PATH.

3.  Install dependencies:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  Build in Visual Studio or your preferred C++ compiler.

### Building in Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated (follow the instructions on [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio)).
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be located in the `bin` folder.

### Building with a C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure that all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg**.
2.  Compile using:

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line: Developer-Friendly Features

Use these commands:

1.  **-s / -search**  
   Brute-force seed phrase generation. *USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION*

2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**
	Track Solana addresses.

3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**
	Generate Solana wallets.

4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**
	Extract wallet data from the mnemonic.

5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**
	Check wallet balance. This is a core tool for developers.
